Hypothesis Testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or decisions about a population based on sample data. It starts with a null hypothesis (H0), which represents a default stance or no effect, and an alternative hypothesis (H1 or Ha), which represents what we aim to prove or expect to find. The process involves using sample data to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, based on the likelihood of observing the sample data under the null hypothesis.

About Dataset:
An online bookstore is looking to optimize its website design to improve user engagement and ultimately increase book purchases. The website currently offers two themes for its users: “Light Theme” and “Dark Theme.” The bookstore’s data science team wants to conduct an A/B testing experiment to determine which theme leads to better user engagement and higher conversion rates for book purchases.

The data collected by the bookstore contains user interactions and engagement metrics for both the Light Theme and Dark Theme. The dataset includes the following key features:

Theme: dark or light
Click Through Rate: The proportion of the users who click on links or buttons on the website.
Conversion Rate: The percentage of users who signed up on the platform after visiting for the first time.
Bounce Rate: The percentage of users who leave the website without further interaction after visiting a single page.
Scroll Depth: The depth to which users scroll through the website pages.
Age: The age of the user.
Location: The location of the user.
Session Duration: The duration of the user’s session on the website.
Purchases: Whether the user purchased the book (Yes/No).
Added_to_Cart: Whether the user added books to the cart (Yes/No).
Your task is to identify which theme, Light Theme or Dark Theme, yields better user engagement, purchases and conversion rates. You need to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the key metrics between the two themes.


Summary
So, Hypothesis Testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or decisions about a population based on sample data. It starts with a null hypothesis (H0), which represents a default stance or no effect, and an alternative hypothesis (H1 or Ha), which represents what we aim to prove or expect to find. The process involves using sample data to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, based on the likelihood of observing the sample data under the null hypothesis.
